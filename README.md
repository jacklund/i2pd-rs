# i2pd-rs
I2P Daemon written in Rust

This is an attempt to see about writing an [i2p](https://geti2p.net/) server in Rust.
There is already one written in [C++](http://i2pd.website/), but I feel like Rust is a much better language
for security- and privacy-related tools.

Plus, I wanted to try writing a network server in Rust. :-)
